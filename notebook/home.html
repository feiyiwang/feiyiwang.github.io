        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>Machine learning as a discipline aims to design, understand and apply computer programs that learn from experience (i.e., data) for the purpose of modeling, prediction, or control.</p>
        <p class="concept1">Types of machine learning:</p>
        <p><u>Supervised learning</u> - prediction based on examples of correct behavior</p>
        <p><u>Unsupervised learning</u> - no explicit target, only data, goal to model/discover</p>
        <p><u>Semi-supervised learning</u> - supplement limited annotations with unsupervised learning</p>
        <p><u>Active learning</u> - learn to query the examples actually needed for learning</p>
        <p><u>Transfer learning</u> - how to apply what you have learned from A to B</p>
        <p><u>Reinforcement learning</u> - learning to act, not just predict; goal to optimize the consequences of actions</p>
