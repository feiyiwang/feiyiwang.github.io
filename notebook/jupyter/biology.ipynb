    "### Enzyme 酶\n",
    "Enzymes are both proteins and biological catalysts (biocatalysts). Catalysts accelerate chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates.\n",

    "### Kinase 激酶\n",
    "In biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process is known as phosphorylation 磷酸化作用, where the substrate gains a phosphate group 磷酸基团 meanwhile ATP 三磷酸腺苷 高能 $\\Rightarrow$ ADP 二磷酸腺苷 低能"
