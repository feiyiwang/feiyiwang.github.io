    "#### locus / loci\n",
    "a locus (plural loci) is a specific, fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic marker is located。 Each chromosome carries many genes, with each gene occupying a different position or locus; in humans, the total number of protein-coding genes in a complete haploid set of 23 chromosomes is estimated at 19,000–20,000.\n",

    "The chromosomal locus of a typical gene, for example, might be written 3p22.1, where:\n",

    "an allel is a variant form of a given gene,[4] meaning it is one of two or more versions of a known mutation at the same place on a chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### genotype\n",
    "The genotype is the part of the genetic makeup of a cell, and therefore of any individual, which determines one of its characteristics (phenotype).\n",
    "\n",
    "The genotype is one of three factors that determine phenotype, along with inherited epigenetic factors and non-inherited environmental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### phenotype\n",
    "The term covers the organism's morphology or physical form and structure, its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code, or its genotype, and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting phenotype.\n",
