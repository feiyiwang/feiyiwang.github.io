    "### Philadelphia chromosome\n",
    "A characteristic chromosomal translocation. DNA is \"swapped\" between chromosomes 9 and 22. This leads to the formation of an oncogene called BCR-ABL which produces the BCR-ABL protein, which is one type of tyrosine kinase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The BCR-ABL chimeric gene product has a tyrosine kinase activity several fold higher than it's normal counterpart and correlates with the disease phenotype. This protein affects multiple signaling pathways that directly affect apoptotic potential, cell division rates, and different stages of the cell cycle to achieve unchecked proliferation characteristic (grow and divide out of control) of CML and Ph+ ALL. \n",

    "Specifically, JAK / STAT pathway and Ras / MAPK / ERK pathway get affected.\n",

    "# Chronic myelogenous/myeloid  leukemia (CML)\n",
    "A form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. \n",
    "\n",
    "A clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation 扩增 of mature granulocytes 粒细胞 (neutrophils 中性粒细胞, eosinophils 嗜酸粒细胞 and basophils 嗜碱粒细胞) and their precursors is found. \n",

    "A type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with Philadelphia chromosome.\n",

    "CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called TKIs which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15–25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).\n"

    "#### Symptoms\n",
    "Fatigue, weakness, night sweats, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, bone pain.\n",

    "Enlarged lymph nodes, spleen (felt as a mass under the left side of the ribcage 胸腔)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab tests\n",
    "1. Blood cell counts\n",
    "- Too many white blood cells with a lot of early (immature) cells called myeloblasts or blasts. Sometimes CML patients have low numbers of red blood cells or blood platelets. \n",
    "- Even though these findings may suggest leukemia, this diagnosis usually needs to be confirmed by another blood test or a test of the bone marrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bone marrow test\n",
    "- Cellularity: If your bone marrow sample has more blood-forming cells than expected $\\Rightarrow$ hypercellular; if too few of these cells are found $\\Rightarrow$ hypocellular.\n",
    "- Normal bone marrow contains both blood-forming cells and fat cells. In people with CML, the bone marrow is often hypercellular because it's full of leukemia cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Blood chemistry tests\n",
    "- Measure the amount of certain chemicals in your blood, but they're not used to diagnose leukemia. They can help find liver or kidney problems caused by the spread of leukemia cells or by the side effects of certain drugs. These tests also help determine if you need to be treated to correct low or high blood levels of certain minerals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Genetic tests\n",
    "1. Conventional cytogenetics\n",
    "- Looks at chromosomes (pieces of DNA) under a microscope to find any changes so as to find a Ph chromosome \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\n",
    "- Looks for specific pieces of the BCR-ABL gene on chromosomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n",
    "- A super-sensitive test that can be used to look for the BCR-ABL gene in leukemia cells and measure how much is there even if the amount is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imaging tests\n",
    "1. Computed tomography (CT) scan\n",
    "- They aren't needed to diagnose CML, but are sometimes used to look for the cause of symptoms or to see if the spleen, liver or lymph nodes are enlarged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n",
    "- very helpful in looking at the brain and spinal cord. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ultrasound\n",
    "- look at lymph nodes near the surface of your body or to look for enlarged organs inside your abdomen (belly) such as the kidneys, liver, and spleen. \n",
