    "### Chronic myelogenous/myeloid  leukemia (CML)\n",
    "A form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. \n",
    "\n",
    "A clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. \n",
    "\n",
    "A type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called TKIs which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15–25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symptoms\n",
    "tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible risk factors\n",
    "Radiation exposure: Being exposed to high-dose radiation (such as being a survivor of an atomic bomb blast or nuclear reactor accident) increases the risk of getting CML\n",
    "\n",
    "Age: The risk of getting CML goes up with age\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender: More common in males than females\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cases of CML start during cell division, when DNA is \"swapped\" between chromosomes 9 and 22. This leads to the formation of an oncogene called BCR-ABL which produces the BCR-ABL protein, which is one type of tyrosine kinase. This protein causes CML cells to grow and divide out of control.\n",
    "BCR-ABL TK is several fold active \n",
