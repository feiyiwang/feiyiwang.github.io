                <p class="justify">My passion for data science stems from my study in Data Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
                    There I completed required courses such as Statistical Methods for Data Science, Database Applications Development,
                    Big Data Analytics, as well as several advanced practical projects, in which I applied the machine learning methods
                    I learned from class and data visualization tools I learned myself to the real world data. In one of the projects,
                    the organization I worked for wanted to have a dashboard to understand the insights of their conference data. I used
                    Shiny, an R package, and D3.js to build an interactive dashboard for them to view descriptive statistics as well as
                    two predictive models to forecast future conference attendees, a topic model to extract abstract keywords from attendee
                    comments and a clustering model to calculate correlations between each paired keywords.<br><br>
                    Because of my good performance in the course Statistical Methods for Data Science, I was selected to be the teaching
                    assistant of this course. Like any other teaching assistants, I prepared answer keys, graded assignments and conducted
                    discussions. I thought I would finish my work just like others. However, it changed when I occasionally learned that a
                    student in my class has already earned a doctor's degree in biology. He told me what he had learned from textbooks ten
                    years ago has been hugely different from what he did. More and more advanced machine learning models have been applied
                    to recent biological disciplines, such as macromolecular structure and genomics. As a result, he aspired to challenge
                    himself from another beginning. It was an impressive dialogue, as I realized that I am learning from my students from
                    their motivation for and feedback on taking this course. Particularly, I was inspired by his words to explore the
                    application of data science in healthcare.<br><br>
                    Therefore, I chose to work on a machine learning research project at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) as my Graduate
                    Qualifying Project. There I had access to 60k electronic medical records (EMR) from the Partners Database System. I
                    established a DBSCAN model to sectionize unstructured EMR, a POS-TAG method to select candidates and a classification
                    model to predict section names so as to extract clinical events such as staging, code status, metastasis. Using a neural
                    network algorithm, I achieved the best performance with 0.96 F1 score and 0.98 ROC AUC score. Once I have all the
                    important clinical extractions that physicians and researchers care about, I plotted them on timeline, developed a Clinical
                    Analytics Platform to display the patient longitudinal flow and wrapped the whole project code into an easy-to-use library
                    and documented it using Sphinx.<br><br>
                    The success of this project enabled me to stay at DFCI as a part-time research scientist after my graduation. Originally
                    we planned to do end-of-life decision analysis using a list of deceased patients, EMR and CT scan data. Subsequently, I
                    completed all the classic deep learning courses given by Andrew Ng on Cousera, explored some relevant research studies
                    such as Deep Learning for Detection of Diabetic Eye Disease posted by Google and created my first image classification
                    model for category prediction. Meanwhile, in order to understand the text structure, I read hundreds of medical records
                    of these patients suffered from deadly malignancy. With my deepest sympathies, I realized that the work I am doing is not
                    only learning and practicing experience, but also my modest contribution to real people trying to live on this planet.
                    Although this plan was discontinued because of the limited sample size and the inconsistent image standard, it piqued my
                    interests in biomedical imaging analysis and my conviction of being a data scientist in the healthcare field.<br><br>
                    I later worked on another project targeting pathway extraction of prostate cancer patients with my team. In this project,
                    our physicians wanted to validate the effectiveness of their treatments. I extracted systematic treatment pathways from
                    EMR using regular expressions and nltk package and visualized the pathways on timeline using vis.js. I also tried to
                    explore the correlations between patient notes, treatment sentences and medications using word2vec and SNOMED CT. However,
                    three problems prevented me from obtaining a good outcome: (1) lack of labeled data, (2) large proportion of missing data,
                    and (3) inconsistent structure and expression. The more effort I put in this project, the more limitations I could see in
                    our data as well as in my skills, which made me realize that I need to learn more, practice more and have an opportunity
                    with better data resources. The desire became even stronger when I learned that my dear grandma died of thyroid cancer.<br><br>
                    In my last semester, I also started to work at Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Having been working as a commercial oncology data
                    analyst in the past three year, I cooperate with different functional teams so that we, as a complete big unit, can push
                    things moving forward altogether. Specifically, I work with ETL team to make sure the data is well prepared for analysis,
                    with stakeholders to make sure our business needs are fully understood and interpreted, and with brand insight to make sure
                    our KPI’s are well-defined. I generate analytical reports such as line of therapy, dose pattern, medical adherence on basis
                    of claims, and lab data and explore an easy-to-read way of visualization for the leadership to understand our market, our
                    patients and our performance. This professional job strengthened my communication skills, teamwork spirit and deep understanding
                    of the real world datasets widely used in the healthcare field. In the meantime, difficulties in causal inference analysis using
                    current datasets also drive me to think of the potential research I could conduct if I also have access to EMR and medical
                    images. Particularly, with richer datasets, I can remarkably enhance the accuracy of the field alert prediction.<br><br>
                    In my Ph.D., I aim to design novel multimodal deep learning algorithms for treatment pathway extraction and causal inference
                    analysis with the utilization of EMR, claims and medical imaging data.<br><br>
                    Klose once said, “I've always known what I was capable of, which is why I didn't lose my self-belief.” Starting from scratch
                    in 2014, earning a master's degree in Data Science and getting a job in the healthcare field in 2017, I also believe that I
                    have the ability to learn things fast and do things well if I have a chance and a belief. As a true devotee of healthcare data
                    analytics, I believe the meaning of my life to learn cutting-edge knowledge and techniques in a field I have enthusiasm and save
                    lives by utilization of the knowledge and techniques.
