        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I was born and grew up in Shanghai, the largest city and financial center in China. It is said
            people in big city only care about making money and chasing fame. I cannot deny some come for a better life
            and some come for better opportunities. But when you walk into these alleys (LongTang) in the morning, eat
            in a local noodle house at noon, and sit in a community park or square in the evening, you can see true
            life in Shanghai. As a native of Shanghai, I feel a strong connection with this city when I hear my grandpa
            sharing his trivia for life with his neighbors, when I gobble up crab pasta made by an experienced cook
            (ShiFu), when I see retired people singing and dancing in a park or square after dinner... You cannot tell
            any difference of a big city from others if you just visit the most popular attractions and restaurants in
            that city.
            We have our own dialect, unique culture and tasty cuisines. Step into a Shanghainese's real life, you will
            know more about this big city with its hundreds and thousands of lovely residents.
